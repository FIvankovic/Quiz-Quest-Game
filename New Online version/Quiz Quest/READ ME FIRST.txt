Quiz Quest Instructions

Start the QuizQuestServer, before the QuizQuestClient. Two clients are necessary to play the game on the same Server. No more & no less.
Opening the Client will prompt you with a "login" GUI. Enter an ip & username. Not entering anything will set a default "localhost" ip & a randomly generated numeric username.
Each GUI has a Info/Help menu option which will explain things further. Read these for further information.


Server:
Server will print information about client connections and game status as it progresses.
E.g. Anonymous executed an action.
     P1: 4 P2: 1 Next turn: P2
-P1 - represents player 1's current position
-P2 - same as P1, just for player 2
-Next turn - the player who goes next
